# Graph-Analysis-Project
A comprehensive Java application designed to analyze and manipulate graph data structures through the implementation of various algorithms.
Developed a comprehensive application in Java that manipulates and analyzes graph data structures. The project involved implementing various algorithms to solve problems related to graph traversal, minimum spanning trees, depth-first search classification, and solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using different heuristic methods.
Key Achievements:
                Algorithm Implementation: Successfully implemented several complex algorithms, including Prim's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees, depth-first search for edge classification, and a bitonic tour for a specialized TSP.
                Optimization and Analysis: Applied multiple strategies to find short tours for the TSP, including greedy, in-order, shuffled, and insertion heuristics. Improved solution quality through iterative optimization techniques.
                Software Engineering Practices: Applied good coding practices, such as modularization and creating reusable components, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
                Problem Solving: Demonstrated strong analytical skills by solving complex problems related to graph theory and algorithm design.
